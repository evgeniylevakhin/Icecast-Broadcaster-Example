# Icecast Broadcaster Example

This is a working example of how to stream audio to Icecast with C# using mono while running linux/debian. 

It's used as a reference for a post on my website [Streaming audio files using Icecast2 and C#](http://jonoie.com/2019/01/23/streaming-audio-files-using-icecast2-and-c-.php).

OGGEncoder.cs is a program from a different project, but shows how to prepare the audio files to be optimally played through Icecast2.
